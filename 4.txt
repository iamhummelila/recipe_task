WAFER BISCUITS

(Cialdoni)

5 servings

Preparation time: 40 minutes

*	3	ounces	flour
*	1	ounces	brown sugar
*	0.5	ounces	lard virgin
*	7	tbsp	cold water

First dilute the flour and the sugar in the water, then add the lard.

Put on the fire the iron for waffles or better an appropriated iron for
flattened wafers.

When it is quite hot open it and place each time half a tablespoonful
of the paste. Close the iron and press well.

Pass over the fire on both sides, trim all around with a knife and open the iron
when you see that the wafer is browned.

Then detach it from one side of the iron and hot as it is roll it on the iron
itself or on a napkin using a little stick. This operation must be made with
great rapidity because if the wafer gets cold, it cannot be rolled.

Should the wafers remain attached to the iron, grease it from time to
time, and if they are not firm enough, add a little flour.

These wafer-biscuits are generally served with whipped cream.
